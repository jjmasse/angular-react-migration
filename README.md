# Angular/React Migration Example Project

## Goals

This project is intended to provided a working example of a path that
explores a migration plan for an Angular 1 code base to a react code base.

### TODOs

#### Routing

Since the target code bases are using some advanced routing, this example
will initially focus on routing using UI-Router.

#### Modernized build process

The goal of this project is to take advantage of Webpack.  Webpack is known
to help keep a projects build configuration in check while also providing good
development tooling - webpack-dev-server for instance.

This project will provide the MINIMAL INVENTORY of plugins and tooling to get
a project up and running.
